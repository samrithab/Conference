# Conference Systen

This is a java application that I have created in a team of 8 (Contributers: Samritha Balamoni, Tiffanie Truong, Matthew Zhu, Robin Huo, Thaneeshan Kethees, Angela Uzelac, Rudy, Brandon) for a software design course at UofT (2020). 

There are two phases. Phase one contains the intitial submission of the project. Phase two contains the updated version with additional features of the project.

Specification for Phase one can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A2u0Ui856yegM5r2J8LqRG74khiO2OLuibn-QGLL9eY/edit?usp=sharing 

Specification for Phase two can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q6im5kj5PQUNLDpTOpCXAkhVE34jaB9UlwEF9ICOFZ8/edit?usp=sharing

My Role: 
In this project I was resposible for the following:
1) The "Scheduling" process which required me to enable the Organizer to schedule each speaker to give a talk at specific times in specific rooms, without double-booking a speaker (scheduling them to speak two places at the same time) or double-booking a room (scheduling two people to speak in the same room at the same time)
2) Enhance the user's messaging experience by allowing them to "mark as unread", delete, or archive messages after reading them.
3) Making account creation more realistic. If a username is already in use, the user is recommended a similar username that is available. All account creation has strict password requirements using regex.
